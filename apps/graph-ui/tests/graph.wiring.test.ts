// WIRING GUARDS: React-side rules that the pure tests cannot see
// =============================================================================
//
// No React harness runs under node:test, so the rules that decide whether the UI stays in
// step with its state are pinned by reading the source. Each one guards a failure that
// only shows in a browser:
//
//   --  Escape must close the inspector: disposing the graph session when a new result
//       arrives would drop the surface's subscription, so closing the inspector would
//       change the state and nothing would re-render.
//   --  a refreshed discovery list hands back a NEW endpoint object for the same connection;
//       rebuilding the graph session from it would silently drop the user's selection,
//       inspector and expansions.
// =============================================================================
